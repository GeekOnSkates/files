# IDEAS FOR FUTURE VERSIONS

* In the text box, implement shortcuts like:
	- undo/redo (CTRL+Z/Y)
	- cut/copy/paste/select all (CTRL+X/C/V/A)
	- text selection (Shift and/or CTRL + arrows)
* In the list box, implement first-letter navigation
* For terminals with color, add color settings
* Add mouse support
* Undo/redo file actions (possible?)  It is in GUIs.
* When no files are found, search the folder for the
	text the user has entered (i.e. there may not be
	a /var/www/html, but if there's a /var/www/ht, it
	should catch that and add it to the list.
